The Hunna are an English rock band from Hertfordshire, England, formed in 2015. The band members are singer/guitarist Ryan (Tino) Potter, lead guitarist Daniel (Dan, BD) Dorney, bassist Junate (Prince) Angin, and drummer Jack (IK) Metcalfe.[1] The band takes inspiration from a wide range of sources, including bands like Kings Of Leon, Foals, The 1975, You Me at Six and Queen.[2]Members Dan and Ryan met while attending the same college. Dan and Junate had known each other for several years and learned to play guitar together. Eventually, they met Jack and the four later formed the band together. According to the band, the name comes from using the slang term "'hunna' in everyday language with each other... We put 'the' in front and landed on 'The Hunna'. The name is also what we are really all about, we give 100% in our music and in our daily lives."[2] They also cite a major hip-hop influence for the band name.[3] They released their first single "Bonfire" in October 2015.[4]</p>
